### Data Cleaning and Analysis

<a href="https://github.com/dlhaar/NYC-SAT/blob/main/NYC-SAT.ipynb" target="_blank">Examining NYC's SAT Scores</a>

This project looks at the relationship between SAT scores and various demographic and educational variables. I cleaned, manipulated, and combined data from different NYC data sets. Then I investigated correlations between SAT scores and variables such as school safety, race, gender, AP courses, and Advanced Regents diplomas. To complete this project I used Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib in a Jupyter notebook. This was a Dataquest guided project that I further developed to consider more variables.
